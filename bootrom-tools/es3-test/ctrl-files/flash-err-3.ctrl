# Test Controller setup for boot-from-flash tests without fallback, and with
# a flash error induced in the process of reading the TFTF image (so, just a 
# longer delay than flash-err-2.ctrl)#
#
# The 10 ms delay is a placeholder ONLY.
# This value needs to be apropriately tuned.
#
# It is based on a calculation toat 10 ms is at most 30KB of flash reading 
# (at 3 MB/sec), so 4KB for each # FFFF header, 1KB for the TFTF header, 
# and 23KB of TFTF data would require at lease 30 ms of transfer time, 
# likely more, so a 10 ms delay should land rigt in the middle of the 
# TFTF read.
#
$ This calculation would be different if the TFTF were signed.

Initial Conditions:
  SPIBOOT_N:		0	# Indicates SPI flash should be used
  e-Fuse preload:	Yes	# Load from the E-fuse data file
  VDDSDIO:		3.3v	# Supply SDIO power at startup
  Boot Bridge:		Yes	# Release Boot Bridge from reset at atartup
  Server Release:	No	# Release Serever (other) Bridge from reset at atartup
  MPHY Connection:	Off	# No UniPro link active

Operations:
  Power ON Boot Bridge
  Release RESET for Boot Bridge
  Delay 10 ms and turn off SPI flash power
  Wait for Handshake at end of test
