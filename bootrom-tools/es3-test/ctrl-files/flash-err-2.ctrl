# Test Controller setup for boot-from-flash tests without fallback, and with
# a flash error induced very soon after the initial read of the FFFF header.
#
# The 2 ms delay is a placeholder ONLY.
# This value needs to be apropriately tuned.
#
# It is estimated based on reading one FFFF header in about 1.5ms.
